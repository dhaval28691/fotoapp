class PhotoStore
  class Upload
    # PhotoStore::Upload uploads a photo to a photo store folder.
    #
    # It uses the created at date, read from the photo Exif data, to calculate
    # the sub folder path, and then the md5sum of the photo for the photo
    # filename, along with the photo file extension. It uploads the photo to
    # this path in the supplied Fog folder.
    #
    # It accepts an options hash as well, allowing you to send :public? => true
    # which will give the file a permanent, and public, url. You can also send
    # :extension => ".jpg" to manually set the extension.
    #
    # Example Usage:
    #
    # => photo_store = PhotoStore.first
    # => photo_path = Rails.root.join("spec", "fixtures", "jonmagic.jpg")
    # => upload = PhotoStore::Upload.new(photo_store.folder, photo_path, :public? => true)
    # => upload.persisted_photo.public_url

      @photo_path     = photo_path
